Part 5","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"What does scientific programming mean? First of all, scientific programming should be focused on an effective and correct solution to the problem. It could be argued that these requirements apply to all software. However, the question is the priority of the criteria. Let’s say, if an office program runs not 0.25 seconds, but 1 second to process a transaction, then this is not as critical as, say, carrying out a calculation within a week or a month. The same applies to the correct execution of the program. It’s one thing for a computer game to freeze, but it’s a completely different thing if there is an error during the calculations that leads to incorrect conclusions or technological disasters.\nBasic moments Here are some points to keep in mind when starting to program scientific problems.\nOptimization of program texts. Very often, a small change in the program text can dramatically increase the speed of calculations. The optimizing compiler is not omnipotent.\nDo not use external routines and libraries. Except in special cases, try to program the algorithms used yourself. Firstly, this will give a comprehensive understanding of the numerical method itself, and, secondly, by implementing it “for yourself” you can achieve the best result.\nSacrifice versatility for efficiency. Universality is one of the most beloved achievements of programming, but for scientific programming the construction of universal software systems is not always justified.\nUse modern compilers. Not everything can be optimized by hand - modern optimizing compilers can seriously increase speed.\nSelect a programming language. Fortran has long been the language of scientific calculations. Indeed, this language has many advantages, but even more disadvantages. Such as:\nThe language of the old generation. This language was developed at the dawn of the computer era, so many important programming technologies, such as modularity, type checking, etc. are not implemented in it. Which leads to errors and difficulties during programming.\nMany routine libraries are already outdated. Progress in the computer field is happening extremely quickly. Therefore, libraries developed for outdated computers may be useless.\nLack of mobility. Despite existing language standards, specific implementations of this language differ significantly.\nBenefits of C++ The choice of the C# language is motivated by the following factors:\nModern language. Programming is an area in which progress occurs very quickly. The C# language, on the one hand, absorbed the best features of the C++ and Java languages, and on the other hand, was created without the need to maintain compatibility with previous versions.\nThe power of the .NET platform. C# is the core language of the .NET platform, so when you program in C#, you are also programming in the .NET platform, which provides you with powerful, well-designed classes.\nEfficiency of language. Surprisingly, programs written in C# running on .NET are very efficient applications. However, when developing complex programs, one should take into account not only the speed of program execution, but also the speed of program development, as well as the complexity of further modification. In this parameter, the C# language is significantly superior to the classical C++ language.\nIn recent years, there has been the emergence of a new computing paradigm - cloud computing, in which the program creator is completely abstracted from where the computing process will take place. Cloud computing refers to the availability of significant computing power available over the Internet on demand. At these facilities, located in data processing centers (DPCs), it is possible to deploy Internet applications, web services, data storage and processing services, etc. By concentrating computing power in economically attractive areas, widespread use of virtualization and automation of node health monitoring, cloud service providers can achieve significant economies of scale and high availability and reliability of the services provided.\nA cloud application consists of a set of services running in a data center. In this case, all issues of launching services and maintaining their functionality are taken over by the computing support environment - the programmer is required to implement the appropriate program code and file with a description and perform deployment. Typically, a cloud application consists of computing components (this could be a web service, a web application, or a computing unit that does not require user interaction) and a data store, which we distinguish here from the term database because, due to the need scaling, non-relational storage is usually used. Computing components are typically programmed in a stateless model, which makes it possible, in the event of a failure, to restart the corresponding component without disrupting the operation of the application. In addition, the environment allows you to run the computing component on several …","date":1713398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1713398400,"objectID":"0f37a544ce2716192b081086f7f67b23","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/post7/","publishdate":"2024-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post7/","section":"post","summary":"What does scientific programming mean?

(When formatting the text, the text editor Microsoft Word is used). It is recommended to reduce the font used in illustrative material (tables and figures) to 12 pt. The line spacing in the main text is one and a half. In illustrative material, it is recommended to make the line spacing single. Page fields should be:\nleft margin - 30 mm;\nright margin - 10 mm;\nupper and lower margins - 20 mm.\nEach paragraph must begin with a red line. Paragraph indentation is 12.5 mm. from the left border of the text.\nEach section of the report must begin on a new page. The names of the structural elements of the report “CONTENTS”, “INTRODUCTION”, “CONCLUSION”, “REFERENCES”, “APPENDIX”, as well as section headings should be printed in capital letters and located in the middle of the line. Sections are numbered with Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3). There is no period at the end of headings.\nSection headings may be highlighted in bold. The use of underlining in headings, the use of two or more types of emphasis in headings (for example, italics and bold, italics and another color different from the main text), word wrapping in chapter headings, and the use of non-standard characters in the report text, including Abbreviations are used in headings. In the text of the report, abbreviations of terms are allowed only after introducing a meaningful definition of the term. All pages of the report (except appendices) must be numbered, starting with the “Introduction”, which is numbered 3. Page numbers are located in the center of the bottom of the sheet without a period.\nIllustrative material (tables, figures, formulas) is included in the report in order to visualize the argumentation and substantiate the conclusions obtained by the student. Thus, only the material that contributes to a better substantiation of the conclusions obtained by the student is placed in the main part of the report. Tables, reporting forms and other factual material, which represents the initial data on the basis of which the research was carried out, are not included in the main text of the work, but can be included in the appendix. It is recommended to include tables and figures based on original factual data directly in the main text of the report.\nIllustrations are numbered within sections. The illustration number consists of the section number and the serial number of the illustration, separated by a dot. There is no period at the end. If the table is borrowed from a book or article by another author, a link to it at the end of the title should be provided, taking into account the requirements of these guidelines. It is not allowed to leave empty cells in table columns. If the relevant data is missing, a dash is entered in the column. Units of measurement must be indicated for digital tabular data. If the table data has different units of measurement, then they are indicated in the corresponding headings of the columns or rows of the table. If all tabular data have the same unit of measurement, then this unit, starting with the preposition “in”, is given above the table after the name separated by commas (for example, in thousand rubles, in hectares, in sq. m., in percent and so on.).\nIf necessary, the table can be moved to another page. In this case, the following design option is used. The headings of the columns (or rows) of the table are numbered, and on the next page the text of the headings is not repeated, but only the corresponding column (row) number is entered. Above the continuation of the table, the words “Continuation of table 1.1” are printed at the top right. The table name is not repeated on the new page.It is not allowed to start a table at the bottom of the page if after the name of the table only the header part remains, or the header part plus one or two lines of content, and the main part of the table ends up on the next sheet. It is not allowed to move a table to the next page if one or two lines of table content are transferred to the next page. In this case, you should either slightly reduce the font size used in the table so that the table fits entirely on the previous sheet; or slightly increase the spacing between the rows of the table so that the table is distributed more evenly across the pages. Pictures include drawings, diagrams, diagrams, graphs, etc. The placement of figures in the report is the same as for other illustrative material, that is, either immediately after the link to it, or on the page closest to this link. Drawings should be placed in the text so that they can be viewed without rotating the work.

Он позволяет создавать тексты без использования Word и других редакторов. Разметку можно прочитать и воспроизвести в любой системе или браузере.\nСоздатель Маркдаун создал писатель и блогер Джон Грубер вместе с веб-активистом Аароном Шварцем. Они хотели придумать максимально простой и удобный язык разметки, с помощью которого текст можно перевести в красиво оформленный вид. При этом текст обязан оставаться читаемым даже без приведения к «красивому» виду. Таким и оказался Markdown. Его создали в 2004 году, но наибольшую популярность язык получил сейчас. Его поддерживают разнообразные платформы для блогов, сервисы создания заметок, CMS и даже мессенджеры. Поэтому маркдаун полезно знать всем, кто имеет дело с вебом, от разработчиков до блогеров.\nКак пользоваться языком разметки Человек пишет текст в любом редакторе и добавляет в него специальные комбинации стандартных символов. Это разметка, она показывает, где текст должен быть жирным, где — заголовком, а в каком месте нужен список. С помощью символов можно разметить заголовки, выделения текста и даже сложные конструкции вроде таблиц. Специальные преобразователи формируют на основе разметки готовый документ. Это похоже на использование HTML, но маркдаун проще, текст в нем более читаемый. Преобразователи или изначально есть в текстовом редакторе, например в приложении для заметок, или скачиваются отдельно.\nДля чего нужен маркдаун Быстрое форматирование статьи для перевода в PDF или чтобы она просто выглядела красиво без лишних усилий.\nВерстка текстового документа для размещения на сайте, но без применения HTML.\nНаписание документации для кода.\nСоставление заметок в личном цифровом блокноте.\nНаписание красивых сообщений в мессенджерах.\nПравила разметки Основной синтаксис. Он очень простой: текст «оборачивается» в символы или они ставятся перед строкой. Вот так, например, будут выглядеть заголовки.\n· # Заголовок H1 (первого уровня, например название текста)\n· ## Заголовок H2 (второго уровня, заголовки)\n· ### Заголовок H3 (третьего уровня, промежуточные подзаголовки)\nИ так далее, вплоть до заголовков шестого уровня с шестью решетками перед строкой. На практике подзаголовки ниже H3 практически не используют.\nВ маркдауне можно применить базовое форматирование текста. Буквицу или рукописный шрифт вставить не получится, но выделить важные участки — легко.\n· Курсив или курсив\n· Жирный текст или жирный текст\n· Жирный и подчеркнутый текст\n· \u0026gt; Цитата (угловая скобка ставится перед каждой строкой цитаты)\n· — Пункт маркированного списка\n· 1. Первый пункт нумерованного списка\n· 2. Второй пункт нумерованного списка (и так далее)\nВставка материалов. Разметка позволяет вставлять в текст разные элементы: ссылки и изображения, которые потом «подтянутся» в документ, когда применится форматирование.\n· [текст_ссылки](любая ссылка) для вставки ссылок\n· [подпись к картинке](ссылка на картинку) для вставки картинок в текст\n· ***, — или ___ — горизонтальная линия на всю строку, которая отделяет часть текста от другой\nА если в тексте должна быть звездочка или любой другой «специальный» символ, который можно прочесть не так, перед ней надо поставить обратный слэш. Например, вот так: *. Тогда символ отобразится в тексте как надо и не считается как правило разметки.\nРасширенный синтаксис. Существует расширенная версия маркдауна. Она называется GFM, GitHub Flavored Markdown. В ней есть другие интересные возможности, например, зачеркнутый текст, обернутый в две тильды, или короткий кусок кода. Многострочный блок кода оборачивается в три грависа над верхней и под нижней строкой. Вот так:\n«`\nЗдесь будет строка кода.\nИ здесь тоже.\n«`\nМожно создавать таблицы, построенные на символах вертикальной и горизонтальной черты. Или «списки дел»:\n— [X] Выполненное дело\n— [ ] Невыполненное дело\nЕсли редактор поддерживает GFM, то все подобные элементы синтаксиса тоже преобразуются и будут выглядеть как на веб-странице. В нем есть даже эмодзи: нужно просто вставить в текст код нужного смайла, обернутый в двоеточия. Примерно так: 😄. Коды эмодзи есть в открытом доступе, их можно посмотреть в интернете.\n","date":1710892800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710892800,"objectID":"07e02bccc368a192a0c76c44918396c3","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/writing-technical-content/","publishdate":"2024-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/writing-technical-content/","section":"post","summary":"Markdown — это язык разметки для текстовых документов.

A version control system is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time and allows you to revert to a specific version later. For file version control, this book will use software source code as an example, although in reality you can use version control for almost any type of file.\nIf you’re a graphic or web designer and want to save every version of an image or layout (you probably will), a version control system (VCS) is just what you need. It allows you to return files to the state they were in before changes, return the project to its original state, see the changes, see who last changed something and caused the problem, who assigned the task and when, and much more. Using VCS also generally means that if you break something or lose files, you can easily fix it. In addition to all this, you will get all this without any additional effort.\nLocal version control systems Many people use copying files into a separate directory (maybe even a timestamped directory if they’re smart enough) as a method of version control. This approach is very common due to its simplicity, but it is incredibly error prone. It can be easy to forget which directory you are in and accidentally change the wrong file or copy the wrong files that you intended.\nTo solve this problem, programmers long ago developed local VCSs with a simple database that keeps a record of all changes to files, thereby maintaining revision control.\nOne popular VCS was the RCS system, which is still distributed with many computers today. RCS stores sets of patches (differences between files) on disk in a special format, using which it can recreate the state of each file at a given point in time.\nCentralized version control systems The next major problem that people face is the need to interact with other developers. In order to deal with it, centralized version control systems (Centralized Version Control System, hereinafter CVCS) were developed. Systems such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce use a single server that contains all versions of files, and a number of clients that retrieve files from this centralized repository. CVCS has been the standard for many years.\nThis approach has many advantages, especially over local VCS. For example, all project developers know to a certain extent what each of them does. Administrators have full control over who can do what, and it is much easier to administer CVCS than to operate local databases on each client.\nDespite this, this approach also has serious disadvantages. The most obvious disadvantage is the single point of failure represented by a centralized server. If this server goes down for an hour, then during that time no one will be able to use version control to save the changes they are working on, and no one will be able to share those changes with other developers. If the hard drive on which the central database is stored is damaged, and there are no timely backups, you will lose everything — the entire history of the project, not counting single snapshots of the repository that were saved on the local machines of the developers.\nDistributed version control systems This is where distributed version control systems (DVCS) come into play. In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients don’t just download a snapshot of all files (the state of the files at a certain point in time) — they copy the entire repository. In this case, if one of the servers through which the developers were communicating dies, any client repository can be copied to another server to continue working. Each copy of the repository is a complete backup of all data.\nMoreover, many DVCS can interact with multiple remote repositories at the same time, so you can work with different groups of people using different approaches at the same time within the same project. This allows you to use several development approaches at once, for example, hierarchical models, which is completely impossible in centralized systems.\n","date":1709683200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1709683200,"objectID":"a6b9817a58033be1d9935d3257cb8188","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/post2/index2/","publishdate":"2024-03-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post2/index2/","section":"post","summary":"This post is about how to get started with Git.
